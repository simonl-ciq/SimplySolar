# Simply Solar / Solar Angles
This is a Garmin Connect IQ widget that provides an easy way to see the Solar Azimuth (or Shadow bearing) & Elevation at the current time and location. It can also show todayâ€™s Solar Noon at the same location.

The calculation is adapted from the Python code at https://github.com/Neon22/sun-angle. The original scripts, and therefore this spart of the work, are released under an MIT licence (https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), without warranty of any kind.
The Solar Noon calculation also derives from the SunCalc widget (https://github.com/haraldh/SunCalc) by Harald Hoyer.

The widget is available from the Garmin Connect IQ store:
